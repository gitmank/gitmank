## I'm aiming for perfection in
1. web - MERN stack development and web security
2. cloud - architecture of cloud solutions and security in the cloud
> yes, I love system design and security more than web and cloud

#### and when I'm done with these I want to
+ explore building performant apps in rust
> this part keeps changing because there's too many I want to try

## My progress so far
+ ```MERN STACK``` -> ```90%```  
#### I can confidently build anything with Next + Node  
> but I'm still
> - improving my development speed
> - learning performance optimisations and best practices
> - learning the new React 19 concepts (like server actions and components)
+ ```AWS Cloud``` -> ```20%```
#### when I hear a problem statement I can:
 - select appropriate services that can be used to build a solution
 - plan how they would connect and communicate
 - figure out which configurations would make the architecture secure
> but I'm still learning to implement such solutions in practice

## My best projects
+ devscene passes - popular ticketing system at my uni
> formless registration + paperless attendance + fast QR checkin + mailing service   
> 4500+ tickets generated at 8+ events

+ an AI-assisted recruitment system for a uni club
> GPT-4 suggestions while filling a form
