# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manomay!
> here's my entire life in one file

## I'm aiming for perfection in
1. web - MERN stack development and web security
2. cloud - architecture of cloud solutions and security in the cloud
> yes, I love system design and security more than web and cloud

#### and when I'm done with these I want to
+ explore building performant apps in rust
> this part keeps changing because there's too many I want to try

## My progress so far
+ ```MERN STACK``` -> ```90%```  
#### I can confidently build anything with Next + Node  
> but I'm still
> - improving my development speed
> - learning performance optimisations and best practices
> - learning the new React 19 concepts (like server actions and components)
+ ```AWS Cloud``` -> ```40%```
#### when you give me a use case, I can:
 - plan a solution with appropriate services
 - optimize the plan for security and cost
 - deploy simple solutions involving 3-5 services
> I'm most comfortable with EC2, ECS, S3, RDS, and VPC

## My best projects
+ [devscene passes](https://devscene.co) - popular ticketing system at my uni
> formless registration + paperless attendance + fast QR checkin + mailing service\
> 4500+ tickets generated at 8+ events

+ [chuckit.xyz](https://chuckit.xyz) - secure file sharing platform
> files are end-to-end encrypted with AES\
> respects user privacy and has super simple UI

## Currently working on
+ passing my AWS SAA-C03 exam, scheduled in Nov 2024!
> I've spent over 100 hours playing with the AWS Console and CLI
