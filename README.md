## I'm aiming for perfection in
1. full stack development with any tools
2. deploying and managing cloud solutions

## My progress so far
+ ```MERN STACK``` -> ```90%```  
#### I can confidently build anything in Node and Python
+ ```AWS + GCP``` -> ```60%```
#### when you give me a use case, I can:
- deploy and manage solutions involving 3-5 services

## My best projects
+ [devscene passes](https://devscene.co) - popular ticketing system at my uni
> formless registration + paperless attendance + fast QR checkin + mailing service\
> 4500+ tickets generated at 8+ events

+ [chuckit.xyz](https://chuckit.xyz) - secure file sharing platform
> files are end-to-end AES encrypted\
> respects user privacy and has super simple UI

## Currently working on
+ my internship at [superjoin.ai](https://superjoin.ai)
+ studying for my AWS SAA-C03 exam
